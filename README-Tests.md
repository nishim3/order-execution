## Test Configuration

- **Framework**: Jest with TypeScript support
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds for long-running tests
- **Coverage**: Configured to track all source files
- **Mocking**: Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies
- **Environment**: Isolated test environment with dedicated configuration

## Key Testing Principles

1. **Unit Testing**: Individual component logic verification
2. **Integration Testing**: Cross-component interaction validation
3. **Mock-based**: Isolated testing without external dependencies
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All critical paths and edge cases
5. **Performance Validation**: Timeout and concurrency testing
6. **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive failure case coverage

## Test Data

- **Token Pairs**: SOL/USDC, USDT/USDC
- **Order Amounts**: 10, 50, 100, 1000
- **Slippage Tolerances**: 0.1%, 5%, 10%
- **Fee Ranges**: 0.2% - 0.5%
- **Connection Scenarios**: Single, multiple, concurrent
- **Error Cases**: Network failures, malformed data, timeouts

This comprehensive test suite ensures the reliability, scalability, and robustness of the order execution system across all critical components.
